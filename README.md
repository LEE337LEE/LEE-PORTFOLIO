# LEE-PORTFOLIO
Having began my journey as a developer in Moringa I sought to find and solve issues affecting the community.
My Journey began during the Pre prep program I began by working on a Fistula project that sort to help improve maternal health care and reduce stigma.
I have also created a forum called Moringa camping which helps Kenyans acquire more information about camping materials and best destinations during this troubling pandemic.
